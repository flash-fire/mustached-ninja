===============

A repository to hold my compiler's project. Also, that was a wonderful suggested name from github!

This code should be amenable to any changes brought by compiler specification changes. The only thing that really has to be changed is how to handle white spaces. IF I made whitespaces less ignored, it'd be fairly easy to, for example, import a Python grammar and let it roll. 

I'm not sure what files were needed as I made this in visual studio. So, I included some of the files, but not all. If it isn't enough, compile it yourself.

To use this to help make your compiler, you'll probably need to modify the lexer [sorry]...
For what changes?
  Reserved word changes go into ReservedWord.txt
  New operators? Those go into the Operators text file
  Grammar changes? You'll need to go to Project2, and follow the instructions there.
