1) def method forgot :
2, 3) dicts had [] instead of {}
4) forgot : for handleSkip()
5) filename shenanigans
6) stupid scoping thing with handleSkip
7) had typo from old handleSkip -- had a : when none belonged
8) used wrong nonterminal set when printing dict

Nothing prints.
   Check vars for print out. Nothing
   Check begin of loop for fail
      Fail occurs
   Check file for non emptyness

9) had if line rather than if not line
10) Forgot parameters in another handleSkip
11) forgot to strip nt before using it
12) Idk what's wrong, but everything BUT code is working.
