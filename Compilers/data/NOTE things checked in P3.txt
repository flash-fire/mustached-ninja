Things that will be caught in my compiler:
	General:
		Syntax errors result in a token that is invalid with original token data.
		This allows nicer printing, and easier checking for errored tokens in semantic stuff.
	Type:
		Malformed tokens for type are found
	Array:
		Check the types of both arguments and confirm to be int
		Check if the first argument is less than second argument
		Check the std_type of the array
